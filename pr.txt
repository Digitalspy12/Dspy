Product Requirements Document
1. Overview
We want to build a web-based application that allows users to upload or drag-and-drop satellite (or other) images. The system will then use a YOLOv11m model (pre-trained or custom-trained) to detect specific military objects (e.g., tanks, troops, trucks, vehicles) in the image. The frontend will show:

A map interface (like a tile layer or a stylized map) with pins or markers representing detection locations.
A side panel displaying the list of detected objects and their confidence scores.
The total count of detections.
The ability to view an annotated image if desired.
2. Goals & Objectives
Goal: Provide a seamless user experience to upload images, run object detection, and visualize results on a map.
Objective 1: Ensure the application can handle moderate image sizes efficiently.
Objective 2: Provide clear, concise detection results (object type, confidence, bounding box).
Objective 3: Display results both on a map (for geo-located images) and in a side panel for quick reference.
3. Key Features
Image Upload/Drop Zone

Users can drag-and-drop images or click to select from their local file system.
Basic file validation (e.g., only images of certain file types).
Backend Object Detection

A Python-based backend (e.g., Flask) that:
Loads the YOLOv11m model.
Processes the image.
Returns bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.
Frontend Visualization

A map interface (e.g., Leaflet) to display markers for each detected object (if geospatial data is provided or approximated).
A side panel (or overlay) listing each detection:
Object type (e.g., “Military Tank”)
Confidence score (e.g., 98.50%)
A detection counter (e.g., “Detected Objects: 88”).
Optional: Display the annotated image (bounding boxes) in a separate view or pop-up.
Results Storage & Sharing

Temporary storage of the annotated images on the server.
Option to download or view the annotated image.
4. Functional Requirements
FR-1: Upload Mechanism

The user can upload an image file (JPG, PNG, etc.).
The system should handle images up to a certain size (configurable).
FR-2: Detection Processing

The backend receives the uploaded image.
The YOLOv11m model infers bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.
The server returns a JSON response with detection data and a URL to the annotated image.
FR-3: Frontend Display

The map or main UI shows markers/pins at relevant coordinates (if geospatial data is known).
The side panel lists each detected object with its confidence score.
A summary of total detections is shown.
FR-4: Image Annotation Display

Users can view the annotated image on a separate pop-up or panel.
FR-5: Performance

The system should process an image within a reasonable time (under ~5 seconds for typical images).
5. Non-Functional Requirements
NFR-1: Security

Validate file uploads to prevent malicious content.
Use HTTPS in production.

NFR-2: Maintainability

Code should be modular and well-documented.
Clear separation of frontend and backend.
6. Technical Stack
Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI), PyTorch, OpenCV, YOLOv11m model.
Frontend: (potentially React, Next.js, or any framework).
For map rendering, Leaflet or Mapbox or another map library.
Deployment: Docker (optional), or any hosting service that can run Python web apps.
7. User Flow
User opens the web app → sees a map and a side panel.
User uploads an image via drag-and-drop or file selector.
Backend processes the image → returns detection data and annotated image path.
Frontend:
Shows detection results on the map (if location data is available).
Displays detection info in the side panel (class, confidence).
Shows a link or pop-up to view the annotated image.
User can close, download results, or upload another image.
